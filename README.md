# R_sedf-made_function_list
introduction self-made function for R that I Google from internet.

# Description  
### input function: read_str(), read_num()
In R, strings can input by `readline()` function. But, numbers required change type by `as.numeric()` function.   
These function is easy to use because these are like the function of Python and Fortran90.

### binding string function: &
The function can bind strings like `+`  on Python and `//` on Fortran90.
